# random-movie-generator


I created a chrome extension that generates a random movie.
I used Html,css,Javascript and two api to make it work.
Ai movie recommender is an api which I found on [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/). This api recommends a random movie by diplaying its title.
The other api I used was [The OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Based on the movie title that was given by the first api it search's and displays the movies poster if avaiable.

If you wish to use this extension it requires to api keys
Ai movie recommender
The OMDb API

Download the repository
open chrome extension and enable developer mode
click load upacked 
then click the button to generate the movie
